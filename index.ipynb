The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working). This lesson will show how this setup works using python. \n","\n","## Objectives\n","\n","You will be able to: \n","\n","* Explain the HTTP request/response cycle\n","* List the status codes of responses and their meanings\n","* Obtain and interpret status codes from responses\n","* Make HTTP GET and POST requests in python using the `requests` library\n","\n","## The `requests` Library in Python\n","\n","Dealing with HTTP requests could be a challenging task  any programming language. Python with two built-in modules, `urllib` and `urllib2` to handle these requests but these could be very confusing  and the documentation is not clear. This requires the programmer to write a lot of code to make even a simple HTTP request.\n","\n","To make these things simpler, one easy-to-use third-party library, known as` Requests`, is available and most developers prefer to use it instead or urllib/urllib2. It is an Apache2 licensed HTTP library powered by urllib3 and httplib. Requests is add-on library that allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. With this library, you can access content like web page headers, form data, files, and parameters via simple Python commands. It also allows you to access the response data in a simple way.\n","\n","![](images/logo.png)\n","\n","Below is how you would install and import the requests library before making any requests. \n","```python\n","# Uncomment and install requests if you don't have it already\n","# !pip install requests\n","\n","# Import requests to working environment\n","import requests\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: requests in c:\\users\\user\\anaconda3\\envs\\learn-env\\lib\\site-packages (2.32.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in c:\\users\\user\\anaconda3\\envs\\learn-env\\lib\\site-packages (from requests) (3.3.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in c:\\users\\user\\anaconda3\\envs\\learn-env\\lib\\site-packages (from requests) (3.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in c:\\users\\user\\anaconda3\\envs\\learn-env\\lib\\site-packages (from requests) (1.26.19)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in c:\\users\\user\\anaconda3\\envs\\learn-env\\lib\\site-packages (from requests) (2024.8.30)\n","Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.\n"]}],"source":["# Code here\n","%pip install requests\n","import requests"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## The `.get()` Method\n","\n","Now we have requests library ready in our working environment, we can start making some requests using the `.get()` method as shown below:\n","```python\n","### Making a request\n","resp = requests.get('https://matplotlib.org/')\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Code here \n","resp=requests.get('https://matplotlib.org/')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["GET is by far the most used HTTP method.
